Story... (Title: “Second Place in My Own Story”) (SEASON PERTAMA AHAHAHHA)
Episode 1: The Space Between Us 
I thought I had someone. Turns out, I was just convenient.


---

Mom says I was too young to remember the divorce.
But I do.
I was seven, in the middle of second grade.
I remember Dad leaving without hugging me.
I remember how cold Mom's hands felt the day after.

Now I’m twelve.
And the house isn’t mine anymore.

I live with Mom, her new husband, and all his shadows.

Zaidan is their son.
Five years old.
He gets bedtime stories, warm milk, and kisses on the forehead.

I get:
“Could you turn that down?”
“Don’t slam the door.”
And sometimes... nothing at all.

Then there’s Flower.
She’s my step-sister.
Older. Chill. Always in her own world.
She doesn’t hate me.
She just doesn’t really see me.

No one here does.


---

That’s why Rayun and Gerrald mattered.

Rayun — the girl who could talk about cartoons and the universe in the same sentence.
She felt safe. Like a book you don’t want to finish.

And Gerrald?
He’s… hard to explain.

Everyone likes him.
He knows how to make people like him.
He knows what to say, when to say it, and who to say it in front of.

With me, he was different — or maybe I just thought he was.

We shared secrets.
Played games no one else understood.
I told him things I didn’t even tell Flower.

He told me he hated fake people.
Said he liked how I was “real.”

I believed him.


---

Then things started to shift.

I told him I didn’t like Rayun.
Not like that.
I just wanted to see what he’d say.

His smile was too fast.
His reply too casual.
“Good. Would’ve been messy if you did.”

But a week later, he and Rayun were texting every night.

Then she started pulling away from me.
Soft at first.
Until even her “hi” in the hallway felt rehearsed.


---

One day, I said to Gerrald,
“Her circle’s fun, right? They laugh a lot.”

He looked up from his phone.
“Yeah,” he said, not looking at me.
“You wouldn’t fit in though.”

I laughed.
But it felt like being punched in the stomach with a smile.

Later that day, he told Rayun.
About our secret talks.
About what I said.
About how I “lied” and “manipulated” her.

Funny, coming from him.

He told me he wouldn’t say anything.
He said, “Bro code. Trust.”

I trusted.

He turned it into poison.


---

That night, I stayed out late on purpose.
Walked around the neighborhood until the sky turned purple.
Came home, and no one noticed.

Zaidan was watching cartoons.
Mom was laughing in the kitchen.
Flower was upstairs blasting music.

I was just a ghost in my own house.


---

People think being twelve means you don’t understand.
But I do.

I understand what it feels like to be replaced.
To be quiet because no one listens.
To miss people who act like you never existed.

I understand what it feels like to give someone a key —
only for them to lock you out.


---

Episode 2: Nothing Makes Sense Anymore
It’s not just the silence. It’s who caused it.


---

I don’t know what I did wrong.

One minute we were fine —
me, Rayun, Gerrald.

The next?
Everything feels off.
Like I walked into a conversation I wasn’t supposed to hear.
Like I’m suddenly the joke, and no one’s laughing with me anymore.


---

It started small.
Rayun stopped waiting for me after class.
She started sitting closer to Gerrald at lunch.
Their laughs got louder.
Not real loud — sharp loud.
Like they wanted me to hear.

Then came the looks.

Gerrald would glance my way,
say something under his breath,
and Rayun would smile like she knew exactly who the punchline was.

It was me.


---

I asked once,
“Did I do something?”

Rayun blinked slow and said,
“You’re just... different lately. We’re all just growing up.”

Growing up?
What does that even mean when you’re twelve?

Growing up just feels like people leaving one by one.


---

Gerrald doesn’t talk to me unless there’s someone else around now.

And when he does talk?

He says stuff like:

“Bro, why you always look so depressed?”

“You mad again? So dramatic.”

“No offense, but like… lighten up.”


Every word hits harder when it comes from someone who used to know the quiet parts of you.


---

At home, everything’s blurry.

I forgot my science homework.
I snapped at Flower when she asked if I was okay.
I stared at the dinner table so long Mom asked if I was sick.

I told her no.
She didn’t ask again.

Zaidan was singing loudly in the living room.
I wanted to scream.
But I just put on my hoodie and sat outside instead.

The sky was dark,
but not as dark as how it felt in my chest.


---

I started second-guessing everything.
Maybe I did something.
Maybe I am annoying.
Maybe I should’ve just stayed quiet.
Maybe I ruin every good thing I touch.

I didn’t know who to talk to.
Flower wouldn’t get it.
Zaidan's five.
And Mom only sees me when I make a mistake.

So I talked to the wall.

“I don’t get it.
I didn’t change.
Why did they?”

The wall didn’t answer.


---

Today, Gerrald walked past me and said:
"Must suck not having anyone, huh?"

I didn’t look at him.
But I felt something crack.

I’m twelve.
I’m not supposed to be this tired.


---

That night, I wrote one sentence in my notebook:

“I think I’m starting to disappear.”



And honestly?

I don’t even think anyone would notice.


---

Episode 3: The One Who Notices
Boys cry too. Just not where anyone can see.


---

Lately, I cry more than I used to.
Not loud, not messy — just that quiet kind.
Where your chest feels heavy,
your eyes burn,
and your throat closes like it’s scared of being honest.

Sometimes it happens when I’m alone.
Sometimes, worse — it happens when people are still around.


---

At school, Rayun and Gerrald are basically inseparable now.

They act like I was never there.
Like I’m some weird chapter in their lives they just skip over.

I hear them laugh.
I hear Gerrald say my name sometimes, then lower his voice and snicker.

I don’t know what hurts more —
the fact they talk about me,
or the fact they don’t talk to me.


---

In class, I messed up a math problem.
Simple stuff.
Gerrald leaned over and whispered,
“Guess even crybabies can’t count.”

I blinked hard.

No.
Not here.
Not now.

I bit the inside of my cheek to stop the tears.
Swallowed everything down like poison.
Laughed it off.

But I felt it —
that tightness in my chest again.
Like I was gonna break just from being looked at too long.


---

After school, I hid in the laundry room.

It’s always warm there.
And the humming machine is loud enough to cover soft crying.

I cried into my sleeve.
Only for like, two minutes.
But it felt like an hour.

I didn’t even hear her come in.

Flower.

“Shawn?” she said, surprised, but not mean.

I wiped my face fast.
Didn’t look up.

“You okay?”

I nodded.

Lied.

She stood there for a second.
Didn’t move.
Didn’t leave.

“You’ve been... weird lately.”

I shrugged.
Still facing the wall.

She didn’t laugh.
Didn’t tease.

“You don’t have to fake it, y’know.”

I didn’t answer.
But something in me cracked again — not the sad crack.
The kind that makes you wonder if maybe, maybe, someone actually sees you.


---

That night, Zaidan threw a tantrum over some broken toy.

I flinched at the yelling.
The noise always feels like a punch to the stomach.

Mom ran to him, hugged him.
Said, “It’s okay. You’re just upset. You can cry.”

I stood behind the door and whispered to myself:

 “Why wasn’t it okay when I cried?”




---

Later, I wrote in my notebook:

“I’m not strong. I just hide faster than most.”
“I wish I didn’t have to.”



And just before I closed it, I added:

“Flower didn’t look at me like I was weak today. That’s new.”




---

Episode 4: Her Name Was Chessie
I said I didn’t like her. But I noticed everything about her.


---

Middle School of Someone.
Same loneliness.
Just taller ceilings.


---

Kai shows up first day with a new haircut and zero shame.
“SMP era, bro,” he says, “new me, same trauma.”

We laugh.
The kind of laugh that only lasts a few seconds.
But I take it.
Lately, seconds are everything.


---

We’re chilling near the courtyard when we see her.

Running.

Like she’s part of the wind.

Short black hair bouncing with each step.
Long strides, smooth arms, no wasted motion.

She wasn’t just fast.
She was quiet fast.
The kind of fast that didn’t try to prove anything —
it just was.

“Bro,” Kai whispers, frozen mid-bite of his lunch bread.
“That’s her. That’s the one.”

I blink.
“The one what?”

“The one who’s gonna make me fake join track & field.”

“She’s just running.”

“She’s rewriting gravity.”

I roll my eyes.
“I don’t like her.”

“Didn’t ask,” Kai grins.


---

Later in class, the teacher sends Chessie to get extra worksheets.

“Can I help her, Miss?” Kai blurts, hand up before I even process.

The teacher squints.
“...To the photocopy room?”

Kai nods like his life depends on it.
Swear he almost bows.

The teacher sighs.
“Fine. Be quick.”

He turns back to me before following her and whispers,
“Two-person bathroom break, baby. History books will remember this.”

I shake my head, grinning.
Dumbass.


---

When he comes back, I raise an eyebrow.
He shrugs.

“She smelled like soap and victory.”

I say nothing.
But I did want to ask.

What soap?


---

We hear her name later at lunch.

 “That’s Chessie. She’s OSIS and a track kid. Don’t mess with her unless you’re built like speed.”



Of course her name’s Chessie.
Of course.


---

At home, Flower’s at the kitchen counter, pouring cereal at 6 p.m.

“First day okay?”

I nod.
Lie.

She looks at me too long.
Says nothing.

But her silence feels like she’s almost figured something out.


---

I scroll the old group chat.
Muted, as always.

Rayun posts a blurry pic of her new school.
Gerrald responds:

“No crying benches here lol”



Same garbage.
Different building.


---

Kai messages me privately.

“Don’t let ghosts from SD live rent-free, bro. You in a new anime now.”



I reply:

“Yeah.”



But my hands shake a little.


---

Before I sleep, I write:

 “I said I didn’t like her.”



“But when she ran, it felt like she wasn’t just fast — she was untouchable.”



“Her name was Chessie.”




---

Episode 5: Something Like Warmth
I didn’t expect her to notice. But she did.


---

Second week of school.

Still feels like walking in someone else’s shoes.
Still feels like waiting for something to go wrong.


---

PE class.

Coach splits us into two groups:
the “runners” and the “others.”

Kai, of course, fake limps to the “others” group.
“Save your energy, bro,” he whispers, “real warriors rest.”

I don’t even try to be in the fast group.
Just wanna blend in, move on, disappear.

But I run.

And I don’t try.

And I still leave people behind.


---

Later, while I’m tying my shoes near the track, someone stops in front of me.

Black sneakers. Clean socks. Calm energy.

I look up.

It’s her.

Chessie.


---

“You ran today,” she says.

I blink.
“Uh… yeah.”

“You’re good.”

I shrug. “Just okay.”

“You’re lying.”

I look at her.
She’s not teasing.
Not laughing.

Just stating facts.

“You’re one of the top three from your elementary, right?”

“…How do you know that?”

She smirks a little.
“I read the district competition archive. I’m not a stalker. I’m just… curious.”

I look down, pretending to fix my laces.
My heart’s in my throat.

“You should try out for the team,” she adds.

“I’m not really—”
She cuts me off gently.

“You don’t have to be anything yet. Just run.”

And then she jogs off like it was the most casual conversation ever.

But my hands are shaking.


---

Kai walks up 0.3 seconds later like a Pokémon that just evolved.

“WHAT did she SAY?”

I stare at him.

“Bro.”

“No.”
“You—BRO—she TALKED TO YOU???”

“Please.”

He literally spins.
“This is your anime arc.”


---

That night, I check the old group chat.

Gerrald

“Saw someone from our class in some school’s track list. Wonder if he still cries when he runs.”



I put my phone down.
Block him.
Finally.

Kai sends a meme 3 minutes later.

 “When life gets hard, just remember you made Chessie talk first.”



He’s annoying.
I smile anyway.


---

Before bed, I write:

“She said I was good.”



 “She didn’t ask if I wanted to be.”



“She just saw it.”



 “I don’t know what that means yet.”




---

Episode 6: Not Here to Lose (FULL REWRITE)
I didn’t run to win. I ran to not be invisible.


---

The sky over their school looked grey, even though the sun was out.
Maybe it was just me.

District track meet.
Our team from Middle School of Someone had just arrived.
And yeah — this was Gerrald and Rayun’s school.

Funny how a building can feel like a memory trying to bite you.


---

Chessie walked in front of us —
clipboard in one hand, power in her shoulders.
Didn’t yell. Didn’t over-explain.

Everyone followed.

Including me.


---

I kept my hood up, hoping no one from “before” would notice.
Didn’t help.

We jogged past the bleachers during warm-up.
There they were.

Rayun. Gerrald.

Not in jerseys.
Not warming up.
Just watching.

Gerrald tilted his head when he saw me.
Leaned in to whisper something to Rayun.
She didn’t laugh this time.
She just stared.

That silence hurt more than their voices ever did.


---

Kai jogged beside me, trying to be subtle.
“Wanna throw a rock at them?”

I snorted.
“That’s your solution to everything.”

“I’m consistent.”


---

Before my heat, I sat alone.
Hands shaking like they were cold.

Then footsteps.
Then water bottle.

Chessie.

She crouched next to me.

“You okay?”

I looked down. “Yeah.”

“Bad liar.”

She smiled. The kind that doesn’t mock.
“Just do your thing. We already know what you’re capable of.”

I blinked. “We?”

She stood up.
“Me.”


---

The race started.

And I didn’t think of Gerrald.
Didn’t think of Rayun.
Didn’t even think of winning.

Just ran.
For myself.
For air.
For proof that I still existed.


---

First place.

The scoreboard said it.
But Chessie’s voice is different, even thought it was more likely whisper to me

"Nice.)



Everyone looked at me.
But I only heard her.

I turned toward her voice
and for the first time in months,
I smirked.


---

We walked through the hallway later, Kai at my side, Chessie just ahead.

At the hallway corner—
Gerrald and Rayun.

Staring.

Gerrald leaned in. Whispered something.

Rayun’s eyes flicked toward us.
Toward me.
Next to her.

But this time, I didn’t flinch.
Didn’t stop.

Let them look.


---

That night, I opened Instagram.
Notifications like wildfire.

One from Chessie.

 chessie.sentyou: “You killed it today 🔥🔥🔥”



I stared at it for a full minute.

Then replied:

> “Wasn’t expecting to see you whisper at me.”



> “Me neither lol. You made it easy.”



> “That so?”



> “Mhmm. You gonna keep running?”



> “...Maybe if you’re still encouraging me.”



She replied with a 🤭


---

Five minutes later, Kai barged into DMs:

> “BRO. LEMME SEE YALL’S CHAT RN”



> “Fuck no.”



> “PLSSSS I WANNA FEEL SOMETHING 😭”




---

I laughed.

Until another notification came in.

From Gerrald.

A photo.
Candid.

Me and Chessie walking side by side in the hallway.
Right after the race.
Right when I was smiling.
He must’ve taken it from behind a door or some stairwell.

Below the photo, his text:

> “Cute.
Let’s see how long she stays.”



Something in me cracked.
Not loud.
Not sharp.
But real.

I didn’t reply.
Didn’t block.

I just stared.

My hand was shaking.

And for once—
I wasn’t scared.

I was furious.


---

Episode 7: What You Think Is Funny
Privacy isn’t funny. Especially when it’s the only thing you’ve got left.


---

Things were… decent lately.
Me and Chessie? We’d talk a lot more.
Between classes. After practice.
Even at lunch.

Sometimes she passed me notes.
Sometimes I caught her glancing.
Sometimes—yeah—I smiled first.


---

“Bro, you’re definitely the softboy of this anime arc,” Kai said, grinning, during math.

“Shut up,” I said.

“She calls you ‘Shawn’, but it sounds like ‘My Shawn’. Ever noticed that?” he said.

“I swear, Kai,” I said, glaring.

“Fine, fine. But when you guys get married, I want credit,” he said.

I ignored him.


---

That morning, Flower texted me:

> “Cieee si atlet dapet OSIS 😏” she wrote.



> “Baru masuk udah ngambil anak orang 😭😭” she added.



> “Mind your own business,” I replied.



> “This is my business,” she wrote back. “You’re my weird little brother.”



I didn’t reply.
But I stared at the screen for a little longer than I should’ve.


---

Lunch time.
Me, Chessie, Kai, and some track kids sat near the window.

“Finish this,” Chessie said, handing me her yogurt.

“I’m not your trash can,” I said.

“You’re my recycling bin. It’s sustainable,” she said.

“Gross,” I said, but took it anyway.

Kai whispered to me, “I swear, bro, she’s flirting with you.”

“Eat your rice,” I said.

“She’s flirting,” Kai said again, louder.

Chessie raised an eyebrow. “I can hear you, you know,” she said.

Kai just smiled. “I know.”


---

Two days later, during science class—my phone wouldn’t stop buzzing.

Kai turned to me and said, “Bro. The old group chat’s blowing up.”

“What group?” I asked.

“The SD one. Gerrald’s group,” Kai said.

My stomach dropped.


---

There it was.
A photo.

Blurry, but clear enough—
Me and Chessie at the competition cafeteria.
She was leaning in, I was smiling with her yogurt in my hand.

Caption from Gerrald:

> “Dude said he’d never like her 💀💀💀”



Rayun reacted with: “oh?”
Others followed.

> “Caught in 4K,” someone wrote.
“Shawn got W rizz,” another said.
“Gw kirain lo pendiem, ternyata jago juga 😭😭”



Dozens of replies.
Dozens of eyes.
All from the past I was trying to forget.


---

I stood up from my seat.

“I need air,” I said to the teacher.

She didn’t ask questions.

Kai followed me out.

“Bro. Chill. They’re just—” Kai started to say.

“No,” I cut him off. “They’re not just anything.”

I pulled out my phone, opened the chat, and typed:

> “Better than still obsessing over people who don’t even think about you.”



Sent.

Then I slid into Gerrald’s DM:

> “Post another thing, and I’ll tell everyone what you said to Rayun.”



Sent.


---

After school, I sat alone on the stairs outside.
Sky going orange.

Buzz.
Message from Chessie:

> “You okay?” she said.



I sent her a screenshot.
Of everything.
The photo. The chat. My reply.

> “Damn. You kinda bodied him,” Chessie said.
“Didn’t know you had that in you,” she added.



> “He crossed a line,” I replied.
“I’m done playing nice.”



> “Good. Stay that way,” she said.



I looked at that text for a while.
Then smiled.

Just a little.


---

But then—one more buzz.
Gerrald.

He replied.

> “Funny how fast you folded for someone you ‘didn’t like’.” Gerrald said.



> “You really think you’re different now?” he added.



I stared at the message.

Then typed:

> “At least I didn’t peak in elementary,” I said.



> “Your whole personality is just being mad that I moved on,” I added.



Seen.

He was typing…

Then he stopped.

I threw my phone beside me.


---

Kai sat down next to me.
“Did he reply?” Kai asked.

“Doesn’t matter,” I said.

“…You look pissed,” Kai said.

“Good,” I said.

He whistled. “Damn. Gerrald really messed with the wrong version of you.”

“I’m not the same kid anymore,” I said.

Kai stayed quiet for a second.

“Still soft, though,” he said.

I sighed. “Shut up, Kai.”

He laughed. “Yup. Still you.”


---

That night, I typed:

> “Let them talk.”
“Let him post.”
“I’m not hiding anymore.”




---

Episode 8 – Stay Anyway

I didn’t cry. But I said what I’ve never dared to say before.


---

Me and Chessie got close.
And I don’t mean like "same lunch table" close.

I mean the kind of close where silence isn’t awkward anymore.
Where you can say “hi” just by raising your eyebrows.

Where you know someone’s mood from how they tie their shoelaces.

That kind.


---

We’d walk after practice.
Sometimes she’d let our arms brush.
Sometimes I wouldn’t move away.

That’s progress, right?

Even Kai noticed.

“Bro. Your aura’s different,” he said, poking my arm.

“It’s called deodorant,” I said.

“Nah. You smell like main character energy now.”

“Shut up,” I said.

But I smiled anyway.


---

One afternoon, it rained.

Not heavy. Just soft drizzle.

Everyone else stayed under the roof near the field. Me and Chessie didn’t.

We walked the track slowly, jackets on, hair getting damp.

“I like rain,” she said.

“Yeah?” I asked.

“Yeah. It hides stuff,” she said.

I knew what she meant.


---

“Your friends from your old school,” she said after a minute. “They still bug you?”

I nodded.

“Wanna talk about it?”

“No.”

She looked away, respectful.

But then she said,

“I’m not them, you know.”

My chest felt tight again—but not the painful kind.
More like someone pressing a warm hand against a bruise.

“I know,” I said.


---

Halfway down the track, she slowed.

I stopped.

She looked at me.

“Shawn,” she said.
“Why do you keep pulling away when people get close?”

I didn’t move.

Didn’t joke.
Didn’t smile.

Just said it.

> “Because I don’t want to be left again.”



It came out flat. Simple. Honest.
Not a whisper. Not a sob.

Just the truth.

And for a second, the rain stopped making sound.


---

She reached out.

Slow.
Like asking permission with her eyes.

I didn’t move back this time.

Her fingers found mine.

Gentle.
Not gripping. Not claiming. Just there.

And I let her.

I let her hold my hand.

And I didn’t flinch.


---

We stood there, hand in hand, in the middle of the empty field, while the rain did whatever it wanted.

She didn’t speak.
Didn’t squeeze.
Didn’t ruin the moment by calling it cute.

She just stayed.


---

At home, Zaidan ran around like a tiny maniac.
Flower rolled her eyes at him while doing math homework.
Mom was vacuuming loudly.

I sat by the window, headphones on, and for once —
the world didn’t feel so loud.


---

That night, I wrote:

> “She didn’t ask for a reason.” “She just stayed.” “And I let her.”



> “I didn’t cry.” “Didn’t panic.” “Didn’t ruin it.”



> “Maybe this is what healing feels like.” “Not fireworks.” “Just… someone not walking away when you’re scared.”




---

Episode 9 – 5,000 Miles and Still Ours

Long-distance doesn’t feel far when your heart knows the way home.


---

I didn’t think eighth grade would start in another country.
But here I am.
Korea.

New school.
New timezone.
New language I barely speak.

Still me though. Still Shawn.
Still the same kid who left pieces of himself in a school courtyard back home — in the middle of a light rain, holding hands with a girl who saw through the quiet.


---

I landed the day before school started.
Cold airport. Everyone moving too fast.
Flower texted me a bunch of memes, trying to make me laugh.
Zaidan sent a voice note saying “don’t get eaten by kimchi.”

Mom said, “Don’t be dramatic. This will be good for you.”

I wanted to believe her.


---

And then…
ping

> chessie.sentyou: “You alive or just ignoring me? 😤😤😤”



I smiled so hard the driver asked if I was okay.

> “Just landed. Wi-Fi is sacred here 😭”



> “Show me outside.”



I flipped the camera to the Seoul skyline.

She replied:

> “Okay fine that’s kinda pretty.” “But not as pretty as me 😌”



God, I missed her already.


---

We don’t talk 24/7.
But we check in.

“you good?” here.
 “what are you eating?” there.
Random selfies.
Screenshots of homework.
FaceTime calls at 2 AM (for her) just so I can feel like I’m still on her screen.

One time she fell asleep mid-call.
I didn’t hang up.
Just left it on.

Watched her breathe for 30 minutes before I passed out.


---

Korean school is different.

Strict uniforms.
Shoes you change inside the building.
Everyone bows when they pass teachers.

And the food?
Don’t get me started.
Bibimbap hits harder when you’re homesick.


---

I made new friends.

One of them’s Jisoo.
Soft-spoken. Obsessed with science fiction.
Reminds me of Rayun… if Rayun wasn’t weaponized.

Then there’s Minjae.
Loud. Fast. The Korean version of Kai but with more hair gel.

They’re cool.
But they don’t know me like Chessie does.


---

She started high school a week after I moved.
High School of Lovebird.
Yeah, that’s a real name.

“It sounds like a dating sim,” I said.

“Sounds like I’m gonna get 11 boyfriends and leave you,” she replied.

“I dare you.”

“You wish.”

We laugh.

But sometimes I wonder if she ever feels tempted.


---

I don’t post us much anymore.

Not because I don’t care.

Just… feels like it’s ours now.

Private.

Peaceful.

Not for the group chat.
Not for strangers.
Just for her and me.


---

Of course, Gerrald noticed.

He posted a Story:

> [screenshot of Chessie’s IG selfie]
Caption: “Guess he finally got tired of showing her off 🤷‍♂️”



Followed by some dumb audio like “you fell off.”

I didn’t reply.

Didn’t even block him.

Instead, I posted this:

📸
A window seat in the plane.
Clouds outside.
Headphones in.

Next slide:

Screenshot.
Chat with Chessie:

> chessie.sentyou: “Text me when you land, idiot.” me: “What if I crash into the sea?” her: “Then I’m swimming.”




---

I didn’t need to fight him.

I already won.


---

Time passes weird when you’re in another country.

Some days it feels like I just left.
Other days, like I’ve been gone for years.

But Chessie?

She stays constant.


---

On video calls, she tells me about her new teachers, new teammates, how annoying Kai is.

She holds the phone like it’s fragile. Like I’m fragile.

She doesn’t say it out loud, but I can tell.

She misses me.

Not in the dramatic way.
In the little ways.

Like when she sees something and goes, “You’d hate this.”
Or when she says, “No one here gets my jokes like you do.”


---

One night, I told her:

“I’m scared.”

“Of what?” she asked.

“Of coming back and not fitting into your world.”

She paused.

Then said:

> “Then I’ll make sure my world has space.”



> “Always.”




---

And damn it — I believed her.


---

Before bed, I wrote:

> “She’s 5,000 miles away.” “But I still feel her in my corner.” “LDR isn’t hard.” “Missing her is.” “But I’d rather miss her than ever replace her.”

Episode 10: That Korean Guy Who Came Back

 Kadang, yang bikin orang gak bisa ngomong bukan karena lo ganti gaya… tapi karena lo balik sebagai versi yang gak mereka harap-harapin.




---

Hari pertama MOS di SMA Lovebird.

Semua anak baru duduk bersila di aula. Bau karpet, keringat, dan rasa malas ngambang di udara.
Panitia MOS berdiri depan aula, lengkap dengan blazer, clipboard, dan muka serius.

Pemimpinnya?
Chessie.

Rambut pendek, ekspresi tegas, suara jernih pas baca nama-nama peserta.
Tapi saat dia buka absensi dan nyebut:

> “Shawn.”



Waktu kayak nge-freeze sebentar.
Beberapa siswa mulai bisik-bisik.
“Shawn yang mana?”
“Kayak familiar…”

Lalu… dia berdiri.

Rambut rapi.
Kulit agak lebih cerah.
Pakaian rapi tapi gak lebay.
Tatapan kalem.
Aura? Korea abis.

Shawn maju pelan ke depan, terus jawab dengan suara tenang:

> “Nama saya Shawn.”



Hening.
Lalu…

KAI, DUDUK DI DERETAN TENGAH, LANGSUNG MELEDAK:

 “WOHHH GILAAAAA KAWAN GUE GANTENG BANGETTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT!!!”



Satu aula langsung nengok.

Panitia MOS kaget.
Anak-anak baru pada ngikik.
Chessie nyengir nahan tawa sambil pura-pura batuk.
Gerrald ngelirik dari belakang, terus ngomong pelan:

 “Biasa aja…”



Rayun cuma ngelirik. Tapi diem.


---

Setelah sesi perkenalan, di lorong sekolah…

Shawn jalan santai keluar aula.
Kai langsung ngejar, napas ngos-ngosan.

“BRO. BRO. BRO BRO BRO BRO—GUE PIKIR LO NYASAR DI KOREA, TAPI TERNYATA LO BALIK SEBAGAI BIAS K-POP.”



Shawn nyengir dikit. “Lebay, Kai.”

 “GILA LO UDAH GAK BUTUH LIGHTING. BAWA AURA NYA SENDIRI. LO NYADAR GAK?!”



“Emang lo jadi MC stand up sekarang?”

 “GAK, GUE JADI MANAGER LO MULAI SEKARANG.”



Shawn ketawa kecil. “Udah duluan ya, 'manager'.”


---

Di kantin, suasana makin chaos.

“Lo tau gak, katanya tuh anak baru dari Korea.”
“Dia yang pernah juara lomba atletik antar sekolah di Seoul, katanya.”
“Gue liat dia di koran deh dulu.”
“Gila… ganteng, pinter, atletik. Cie Chessie, OSIS dapet saingan nih.”

Chessie diem aja.
Muka datar.
Tapi telinganya merah.

Pas dia noleh ke arah barisan siswa baru…

Mata mereka ketemu.

Shawn gak ngomong apa-apa.
Cuma kasih slight smirk — singkat, confident, nyindir dikit.

Chessie langsung balik arah.
Jalan buru-buru.
Tapi dia senyum kecil sendiri.


---

Setelah sekolah selesai…

Shawn duduk di taman belakang sebentar, ngeluarin HP.
IG-nya rame.

Dia buka Story barunya:
📷 Foto dari jendela pesawat, langit Korea di luar.
📎 Caption: "Pulang.”

Dan satu lagi…
Screenshot lama. Chat antara dia dan Chessie, waktu dia baru mau pindah ke Korea dulu.
Simpel, tapi penuh kode.

Chessie lihat itu pas dia buka HP di ruang OSIS.
Dia diem lama.

Lalu buka arsip chat yang udah dia simpen dari dulu.
Nama: Shawn.


---

Meanwhile…

Gerrald duduk di bangku lorong belakang.
Liat Story itu juga.

Cuma ngedumel pelan, “Aneh.”

Rayun liat juga.
Tapi gak bilang apa-apa.


---

Sementara itu, Kai update Story sendiri:
📸 Foto Shawn dari jauh di aula.
🗯 Caption:

> “MY BOY BACK FROM KOREA. SOMEONE CALL K-DRAMA WRITER, THIS SHIT GETTIN’ REAL 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥"



Di hari kedua MOS, aula udah mulai kosong.
Chessie duduk di tribun, sendirian, ngelihatin peserta baru yang masih pada latihan yel-yel.

Tiba-tiba, suara langkah kaki dari belakang.
Shawn.

Dia duduk gak jauh dari Chessie, tapi gak langsung nyapa.

Chessie nunduk, pura-pura baca catatan di clipboard-nya.
Tapi… dia tahu. Dia kerasa.

Shawn duduk diem sebentar, lalu nyeletuk pelan.

“Kangen ya?”



Chessie ngedongak. “Apa?”

Shawn nyengir. “Suaranya berubah ga sih.”

Chessie langsung dorong pundak Shawn pelan, “Narsis banget sih.”

Shawn cuman ketawa, lalu ngelirik ke arah lapangan.

 “Lo masih jadi atlet lari?” Celetuk Shawn dengan nada ngejek.



> “Masih,” kata Chessie, suaranya agak lembut.



 “Keren.”



Hening bentar. Tapi bukan hening yang canggung.
Kayak dua orang yang pernah dekat, sekarang lagi cari ritme baru.

> “Pas gue balik…”
Shawn berhenti sebentar.
“...gue gak tau lo masih di sini atau nggak.”



Chessie noleh. “Dan lo gak bilang juga.”

> “Emang.”



> “Kenapa?”



Shawn diem sebentar, terus bilang:

> “Karena kalau lo tau… dan ternyata lo udah berubah, itu bakal lebih sakit.”



Chessie nunduk.

Shawn masih liat ke lapangan.
Suaranya makin pelan, tapi dalem:

> “Gue gak takut kehilangan temen… Tapi gue takut ditinggalin orang yang gue sayang.”




---

Scene lompat ke lorong.
Kai jalan bareng Rayun, sambil ngerocos kayak biasa.

> “LO LIAT MUKA GERRALD KEMARIN?! CUIHHHH DIA NGIRA SHAWN MASIH ANAK LEMES DULU—”



Rayun diem. Cuek.
Tapi matanya ngerasa sesuatu.
Dia liat Shawn dari kejauhan lagi ngobrol sama Chessie.
Aura mereka beda.

> “Kita duluan ke kelas yuk,” Rayun akhirnya ngomong.



> “OKE BOSKU!! GUE MAU DUDUK SEBELAH SHAWN, BIAR GUE KENA CANTIKNYA SECARA LANGSUNG—”



Rayun langsung jitak kepala Kai.
“Lo lebay.”


---

Beberapa siswa lewat lorong.

> “Eh itu bukan yang anak Korea itu?”
“Iya! Yang menang lomba akademik sama atletik katanya.”
“Gila sih, otaknya jalan, kakinya jalan, mukanya juga jalan…”



Shawn lewatin mereka.
Gak ngomong apa-apa.

Cuma… ngelirik dikit ke arah Chessie.
Dan… kasih smirk kecil, yang cuma bisa diartiin Chessie:

"Wle."


---

📱 IG Update

Chessie upload Story:
📷 Foto siluet dua orang dari tribun sekolah, duduk berdampingan.
📝 Caption: “Sometimes the person you wait for… actually comes back.”

Shawn repost.

📝 Caption:

> “Still here.”

Episode 11: That Accent, That Glare

> Kadang yang bikin lo diem bukan karena malu. Tapi karena yang lo tunggu akhirnya ada di depan lo, ngelihat lo balik, dan gak ngedip.




---

Hari-hari pertama MOS lanjut kayak biasa, tapi buat sebagian orang, hari-hari itu gak biasa.

Buat anak-anak baru, MOS itu ngebosenin. Tapi buat Chessie, pemimpin MPK dan panitia MOS, itu kerja rodi. Apalagi sekarang, ada satu nama yang nongol di daftar peserta dan bikin ritme dadanya gak karuan.

Shawn.

Si anak Korea itu. Si mantan anak SD penuh luka, yang sekarang balik dengan gaya ngomong pelan tapi tajam, senyum dikit-dikit, dan tatapan yang gak bisa dibaca.


---

Siang hari, mereka duduk di bawah tangga belakang aula. Tempat yang jarang dilalui orang. Chessie baru selesai ngatur rundown, Shawn baru beres ngisi absen kelompok.

“Duduk sini bentar,” kata Chessie, nyodorin botol minum ke Shawn.

Shawn ambil dan duduk. Hening sebentar. Angin ngebelai rambut mereka yang pendek-pendek.

“Lo beneran berubah,” kata Chessie, lirih.

“Berubah jelek atau berubah bagus?” Shawn nanya, nggak ngeliat langsung.

“Berubah jadi… bukan Shawn yang gue kenal dulu. Tapi versi ini kayaknya udah lebih tenang. Lebih… kayak yang lo harusnya jadi.”

Shawn diem. Matanya ngeliatin bayangan daun yang goyang kena angin.

“Lu juga berubah. Lu lebih… nyuruh sekarang,” Shawn jawab pelan.

Chessie ketawa kecil. “Wajib. OSIS men, bukan boneka pajangan.”

Mereka diem lagi. Tapi bukan diem yang canggung. Diri mereka tahu, ini nyaman. Ini tempat yang entah kenapa bikin dada gak sesak.


---

Di sore berikutnya, Chessie nemu Shawn lagi duduk sendiri di pojokan taman belakang. Dia lagi buka-buka buku catatan kecil, ngeliatin sesuatu.

“Lo nyari ide buat puisi?” Chessie nyamperin.

“Bukan. Ini... catatan lama. Dari Korea,” kata Shawn.

Chessie duduk di sebelahnya. Ngintip dikit.

“Gue belajar nulis bahasa Korea di situ,” Shawn lanjutin. “Kalau lo liat tulisan gue yang dulu... mirip cakar ayam.”

“Gue juga gak bisa nulis Hangul,"
"Buat apa juga lu belajar Hangul." 
 kata Chessie. “Jadi kita impas."



Shawn senyum. Chessie lihat. Nggak bilang apa-apa. Tapi senyum Shawn bukan yang ngeledek. Bukan yang datar. Tapi kayak senyum yang cuma keluar kalau lo ngerasa tenang.


---

Besoknya, giliran Shawn disuruh naik ke panggung buat pidato siswa baru.

Dia gak nolak. Dia gak grogi. Dia berdiri, maju, dan mulai bicara.

“안녕하세요. 저는 샤운입니다.”

Suara Shawn tenang, tapi keras. Satu aula diem.

“오늘은 저에게 정말 특별한 날이에요. 왜냐하면, 한국에서 돌아온 후 여러분과 같은 자리에 설 수 있어서 정말 기뻐요.”

Beberapa anak saling lirik.

“저는 새로운 환경에서 많은 것을 배우고 싶어요. 물론 두려움도 있지만, 우리 함께 좋은 시간을 보낼 수 있기를 바랍니다.”

Shawn berhenti. Lalu lanjut pake bahasa Indonesia.

“Aku pengen belajar banyak di sini. Bukan cuma soal nilai, tapi soal bertahan juga. Saya pengen mulai lembar baru. Dan semoga, kita semua bisa jalanin SMA ini bareng-bareng, gak pake topeng, gak pake pura-pura.”

Tepuk tangan nyebar. Gak heboh, tapi tulus.

Kai di barisan belakang bisik, “Gue nggak ngerti apa yang dia bilang tadi awal-awal, tapi sumpah keren banget.”


---

Setelah acara, Chessie nyamperin Shawn di lorong kosong.

“Pidato lo keren,” katanya.

Shawn nyengir. “Lu ngerti gak?”

“Gak semuanya,” Chessie jawab. “Tapi... gue ngerti maksudnya.”

Mereka jalan bareng ke arah taman belakang. Ngobrol soal Korea, soal lagu, soal buku, soal track.

Chessie nanya, “Lo masih suka lari?”

Shawn jawab, “Masih. Tapi sekarang bukan buat kabur.”

Chessie senyum. Dia nyoba genggam tangan Shawn pelan-pelan. Shawn nggak narik.

Malah diem. Dan bisik, pelan:

> “I don’t want to be leaved again.”



Chessie nggak jawab. Dia cuma genggam tangannya lebih erat.


---

Di lorong belakang, jauh dari mereka, Gerrald berdiri diam, ngelihat dari kejauhan.

Gak ngomong. Gak senyum. Cuma mandang.

Tatapan dia beda.

Kali ini… bukan karena Shawn berubah.

Tapi karena Chessie gak pernah liat dia kayak Chessie ngeliat Shawn barusan.


---

Episode 12: Rewind in a New Frame

> Kadang yang bikin seseorang terlihat baru, bukan karena dia berubah... tapi karena sekarang semua orang akhirnya ngelihat.




---

Pagi itu suasana sekolah rame banget.
Siswa dari angkatan Shawn saling bisik-bisik, pada ngebahas pidato dalam bahasa Korea yang dia sampein kemarin.

“Eh itu yang kemarin pidato Korea?”
“Yang aksennya kayak di K-drama?”
“Gue nonton ulang loh di story OSIS!”

Di lorong, Shawn jalan santai. Tapi kayak magnet, matanya dikerubungin beberapa anak.

“Shawn! Ajarin dong bahasa Korea!”
“Oppa~ ngajarin dong~” kata satu cewek sambil ngakak.

Kai di belakangnya langsung teriak, “WOOO BOY, DULU DICUEKIN, SEKARANG DIAJAK NGOBROL PAKE HANGEUL!”

Shawn nyengir dikit, terus ngebales ke salah satu cewek yang ngomong tadi, “공부 열심히 하세요~”

Cewek itu bengong. “Hah?”

“Belajar yang rajin,” kata Chessie dari belakang, ngebantuin nerjemahin.

Mereka semua ketawa.


---

Di sela jam istirahat, Shawn dan Chessie duduk bareng di bawah pohon dekat lapangan.
Angin pelan banget, tapi cukup bikin rambut Chessie bergerak pelan.

“Aksen lu sekarang… aneh,” kata Chessie tiba-tiba.

“이상하다고요?” Shawn jawab sambil senyum kecil.

Chessie ngebelalak. “Gue nggak ngerti. Tapi ngeselin banget nadanya.”

“Tuh kan,” kata Shawn, senyumannya makin lebar. “Lo ngerasa tergoda.”

Chessie ngebuang muka, tapi pipinya merah.


---

Di ruang OSIS, Flower lagi duduk sambil buka-buka HP.
Temennya nyeletuk, “Eh, itu adek lo ya yang kemarin pidato Korea?”

Flower angguk santai. “Iya, Shawn.”

“Cowok-cowok di angkatan gue mulai belajar nulis hangeul gegara dia,” temennya lanjut.

Flower senyum nyebelin, terus nyender ke kursi.
“Eh, si Chessie deket nggak sih sama Shawn?”

“Wah, lo nggak liat pas latihan kemarin? Mereka kayak nempel magnet,” kata temennya.

Flower ketawa kecil, terus buka Instagram.
“Si Shawn orangnya kayak gimana sih menurut Chessie?” bisik Flower ke dirinya sendiri.


---

Kai, seperti biasa, gak bisa diem.
Pas Shawn dan Chessie lagi jalan bareng keluar kantin, dia langsung ambil HP dan motret dari jauh.

“Bro, gaya kalian kayak cover webtoon. Wajib tayang di IG.”

Tanpa nunggu, Kai langsung post ke IG Story:
📸 @kai.wth

> “CHESSIE X SHAWN COLLAB? 😭😭🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥"

Di grup angkatan, notif gak berhenti bunyi.
Semua mata kayak ngarah ke satu titik: foto Shawn dan Chessie yang Kai post barusan.

> “Fix mereka jadian.”
“Halah baru juga balik.”
“Lo liat gak senyumnya si Chessie?”
“BOOM KONTEN.”



Shawn cuma ngeliat sekilas Story itu sambil ngetik pelan ke Kai:

> “Lu gabisa diem ya.”



Kai bales cepet,

> “GUE MARKETING, LO PRODUK.”




---

Siang itu di lorong kelas, Chessie lagi jalan sendiri.
Flower muncul dari balik pilar, tangan silang, alis naik.

“Jadi…” Flower mulai, suaranya slow tapi nadanya menggoda, “Adek gue itu orangnya kayak gimana?”

Chessie langsung berhenti.
“Shawn?”

“Enggak, Kai,” kata Flower sarkas. “Iya, lah. Shawn. Lo gak jawab, gue spill story IG lo bareng dia ke emak gue.”

Chessie ngedengus ketawa. “Dia... Lucu sih, tapi... jujur.”

Flower ngangguk pelan, senyum licik. “Jujur tuh berbahaya. Apalagi kalau udah bikin lo nyaman.”

Chessie nyeletuk, “Lah, siapa bilang gue nyaman?”

“Yang bilang?” Flower angkat HP. “Story lu.”


---

Sore itu, setelah semua pelajaran selesai...

Shawn duduk sendirian di pinggiran lapangan.
Ngeliatin anak-anak track lagi pemanasan.
Beberapa dari mereka saling ngeliatin dia, jelas mereka notice.

Tiba-tiba, suara dari belakang.

“Pengen lari lagi?”
Chessie duduk di sebelahnya, minum air dari botol plastiknya.

Shawn ngelirik, senyum tipis.
“Boleh join track lagi nggak… ketua?”
Nada suaranya ngeledek dikit.

Chessie pura-pura mikir, “Hmmm… entahlah. Lo masih bisa lari gak sih?”
Dia sengaja nyeletuk sambil nyengir.

“Ya, tinggal kasih aba-aba, pasti nyusul paling depan,” Shawn jawab santai, confident.
Dia ngebales tatapan Chessie dengan senyum menantang.

Chessie diem sebentar, terus ngetawain. “Oke, gue cobain lo dulu di latihan minggu depan. Tapi jangan telat.”


---

Di kelas, beberapa anak mulai buka Google Translate, Duolingo, sampe buka video belajar Korean 101.
Ada yang latihan baca Hangeul di buku catatan, ada yang nekat nyamperin Shawn langsung.

“Shawn, ‘apa kabar’ itu bahasa Korea-nya apa?”
“안녕하세요,” jawab Shawn kalem.

“Cara bacanya gimana?”
“Annyeonghaseyo,” katanya, ngebenerin pelafalan mereka satu-satu.

Chessie nonton dari jauh sambil duduk di kursi OSIS.
Ada senyum bangga di mukanya.

Salah satu temen OSIS nyeletuk, “Gila ya… Shawn kayak magnet.”

Chessie jawab pelan, “Emang udah dari dulu… mereka aja yang baru nyadar.”


---

Malamnya…

Flower update Story juga:
📸 Screenshot chat sama Shawn
📎 Caption:

> “Adek gue balik ke Indo dan jadi idol sekolah… hmm… I’m watching u lil bro 💅🕶️”



Shawn cuma bisa ngetik balasan:

> “😭”




---

Besoknya…
Jadwal latihan atletik.
Shawn dateng paling awal.
Chessie yang liat dia dari jauh, senyum kecil.
Dan Kai, seperti biasa, teriak dari lapangan:

“RUN SHAWN RUNNNN!!! BIKIN MEREKA KESEL LAGI!!!”

Shawn cuma lambaikan tangan sambil ketawa.
Tapi di balik semua itu, matanya udah gak sedingin dulu.
Dia mulai… nyatu.

Bukan cuma balik dari Korea.
Tapi balik sebagai diri yang akhirnya bisa diterima.


---

Episode 13 — Study Tour, Sweet Tension

Pagi itu gerimis tipis pas bis-bis pariwisata mulai parkir di depan SMA Lovebird.

Tiga bis total. Satu buat kelas 10, satu buat kelas 11, dan satu buat kelas 12.

Shawn berdiri di pinggir lapangan bareng Kai. Ransel udah di punggung, jaket tipis nutupin seragam dalemannya.

Kai nyeletuk, “Tebak, kita duduk bareng siapa di bus?”

Shawn cuman ngangkat bahu. “Random, kali.”

“Semoga enggak random sama Gerrald,” Kai desis sambil ngelirik ke arah yang satunya. “Gw males denger orang bacot datar sepanjang jalan.”

Saat itu juga, dari arah lapangan, salah satu panitia OSIS—cewek tinggi dengan clipboard dan suara tajam—teriak, “Yang cowok di belakang! Cepet baris, yang cewek maju duluan!”

Chessie lewat sambil bawa selempang panitia. Bajunya kasual, tapi tetep keliatan effortless. Pas dia jalan di deket Shawn, dia sempet noleh dan… senyum dikit.

Cuma ke dia.

“Wah,” bisik Kai. “Udah dapet blessing duluan tuh.”

Shawn gak sempet jawab. Karena gak lama kemudian, temen OSIS lain—kayak senior deket Chessie—teriak sambil nunjuk ke arah bis kelas 10:

> “Chessie! Duduk depan deket Shawn ya, dia kayaknya suka mabuk kalau duduk belakang!”



Kai yang lagi ngunyah roti langsung berdiri, “SAYAAA MAU TUKER TEMPAT DONG SAMA CHESSIE!!” katanya ngakak setengah teriak.

“Diam, Kai!” ujar panitia.

Chessie cuma nyengir, lalu jalan ke arah bis… dan beneran duduk di bangku depan. Sebelah kiri.

Shawn berdiri sebentar, bingung harus duduk di mana.

Sampai Chessie noleh dan ngetuk bangku kosong di sebelahnya.

“Di sini dong,” ujar Chessie, santai banget. “Daripada lo disuruh duduk sama Kai.”

Shawn diem sebentar. “Lo gak bosen?”

“Duduk sama lo? Hmm… enggak, sih. Malah pengen.”

Shawn akhirnya duduk, narik ranselnya ke pangkuan.

Chessie gak banyak ngomong. Tapi dari awal… dia udah nyender ke sisi bangku. Dikit-dikit nyentuh bahu Shawn. Kaki mereka kadang bersentuhan, dan dia… gak gerak.

Bahkan kadang, tangan Chessie ngelipet selimut kecil dan naruhnya deket lengan Shawn. Cuma biar bisa bersender.

Shawn noleh. “Nempel terus.”

“Lagi pengen,” jawab Chessie pelan. “Gak boleh?”

“Gue bukan guling,” ujar Shawn.

“Tapi lo bisa dipeluk?”

Shawn no comment. Tapi pipinya agak merah.


---

Di perjalanan, Kai beberapa kali nengok dari bangku belakang.

“GILA NIH ORANG DUA!!!” dia bisik-bisik ke temennya sambil moto dari jauh.

📸 Snap.

Post di IG story pribadi:

> “Kelas 10 dimulai dengan drama Korea LIVE.”



Dan gak puas, Kai juga share ke grup angkatan:

> “Real couple detected 🚨: Shawn & Chessie. Bangku depan. Gak ada ruang buat kita 😔✊.”




---

Pas udah sampe tempat wisata pertama—taman budaya gitu lah—Chessie gak nyerah.

Pas turun dari bis, dia masih jalan di sebelah Shawn. Masih kadang nahan lengan Shawn waktu mereka harus ngelewatin jalur ramai. Masih sesekali ngelus lengan bajunya waktu dia diem.

Kai ngejar dari belakang. “Bro… dia tuh kayak… narik lo pake invisible string tau gak?”

Shawn cuman nyengir kecil. “Mungkin dia lagi butuh pegangan.”

“ATAU LO YANG JADI PEGANGAN DIA SEKARANG!” jerit Kai pelan.


---

Siangnya, pas lagi acara keliling galeri, semua siswa dibagi jadi kelompok.

Chessie langsung tarik Shawn. “Dia sekelompok sama gue,” katanya ke panitia.

Panitianya ngangguk aja. “Oke, biar gampang koordinasi ya.”

Shawn cuman ngikut. Tapi pas jalan, dia sempet bilang, “Lo tau kan ini udah kelewat obvious?”

Chessie cuman jawab sambil nyender dikit ke lengan Shawn:

“Bagus dong. Biar semua orang tau.”


---

Sore, waktu balik ke penginapan buat istirahat, Shawn duduk di teras depan sama Kai.

Chessie dateng lagi, duduk sebelah Shawn, bawa selimut tipis.

“Lo gak cape?” tanya Shawn.

“Cape. Makanya duduknya di sini,” ujar Chessie sambil narik lengannya. “Gue pinjem lengan lo ya.”

“Buat?”

“Gak tau. Biar tidur siang enak?”

Dan dia nyender lagi.

Kai liat dari jauh dan ngetweet:

> “Bro gw udah jadi bantal nasional. Berasa V BTS. Proud of u Shawn.”




---

Episode 14 – Road Trip, Red Flags, and Resting on Her Shoulder
Kadang, kita gak sadar kalau lagi jatuh... sampai ternyata kita udah terlalu dalam buat mundur.


---

Hari kedua study tour.

Udah lewat tengah hari.
Sinar matahari nyenggol-nyenggol kaca jendela bus, anak-anak udah mulai kecapekan, tapi belum ada yang mau ngaku.
Bus yang tadinya rame—penuh teriakan, nyanyian, dan tawa—mulai pelan-pelan jadi sunyi.
Kecuali suara Kai, obviously.

“Bro, gue swear... tadi gue liat kakak kelas beli TOLAK ANGIN. Ini tuh touring apa pemakaman sih?”

“Diam, Kai,” ujar Chessie pelan dari bangku depan.

Dia lagi duduk... di sebelah Shawn.
Iya. Dari awal.
Karena salah satu kakak OSIS nyeletuk tadi pagi pas di penginapan:

> “Chessie, lo duduk sama Shawn ya. Anak-anak yang lain kita acak aja.”



Dan Kai yang denger langsung berdiri dari tempat duduk,

> “GAK GAK GAK, GUE MAU PINDAH KE SAMPING CHESSIE! GUE GANTIAN. BUAT BUKTI SOSIAL!”



Anak-anak satu bus ngakak.
Tapi yaudah, udah kejadian.
Chessie duduk di sebelah Shawn.
Dan dari awal, dia kelihatan kayak... gak mau jauh.


---

Pas di lokasi study tour kedua—museum sejarah—Shawn agak ngelamun sambil jalan.
Sampai tangannya ditarik pelan.

Chessie.
Narik lengan Shawn, pelan.
Seolah gak pengen dia ninggalin rombongan.

“Jangan jauh-jauh,” ujar Chessie datar, tapi tangannya masih nempel.

Shawn ngangguk pelan. “Gue gak ke mana-mana kok.”

Chessie gak lepasin.


---

Kai motret dari jauh.
Langsung kirim ke grup angkatan:

> 📸 “SHIPPING MOMENT SPOTTED. MY GUY IS DOWN BADDDD 💘💘💘”



Reaksi? Chaos.
DM Shawn langsung rame.
Tapi dia cuma ngelirik HP sebentar, terus masukin lagi ke kantong.


---

Di area luar museum, mereka duduk sebentar nunggu giliran masuk.
Gerrald lewat, ngelirik sebentar.

“Wah, lo jadi tour guide pribadi sekarang?” sindir Gerrald, nada datar, tapi jelas-jelas buat mancing.

Shawn diem.
Chessie noleh, ngangkat alis.

Shawn balas lirih, “Ngapain sih lo.”

Gerrald cengengesan, “Gue cuma nanya. Chill lah. Lo kan sekarang udah pinter bahasa Korea, juara lomba, dapet cewek OSIS. Keren bro.”

Nada sarkas. Matanya dingin.

Chessie berdiri.
“Gue pergi dulu,” ujar Chessie, sambil narik Shawn lagi, ninggalin Gerrald.

Gerrald cuma nyengir kecil.
Tapi matanya... gak ramah.


---

Di spot wisata terakhir—bukit pemandangan—anak-anak mulai ngumpul buat foto bareng.
Chessie masih nempel. Literally.
Dia narik tangan Shawn terus, nyender kadang-kadang, dan sekali waktu bilang,

> “Kalo lo ninggalin gue, gue bakal beneran ngambek.”



Shawn nyengir kecil. “Oke. Gue jagain.”


---

Waktu makan malam sebelum pulang, Gerrald duduk agak jauh.
Tapi masih ngamatin.

Rayun, yang duduk di sebelah dia, bisik pelan,

> “Dia makin beda ya...”



Gerrald cuma jawab pendek, “Aneh.”


---

Di perjalanan pulang, bus jadi sunyi lagi.
Lampu dimatikan. Angin AC pelan.
Banyak yang udah mulai tidur.

Chessie nyender ke kaca. Shawn duduk sebelahnya, masih megang earphone satu sisi.

Lalu...

Chessie pelan-pelan nggeser.
Narik lengan Shawn.
Terus nyenderin kepala ke bahu Shawn.

> “Gw cape... Tapi gw gak mau tidur sendirian.”



Suara pelan. Hampir kayak bisikan.

Shawn kaget dikit.
Tapi dia gak bergerak.

Dia miring dikit.
Lalu, balas nyender pelan ke arah Chessie.
Kepala mereka sekarang nempel.

Dan pelan-pelan...
Mereka tertidur bareng.
Di tengah gelapnya bus.
Di antara ribuan bintang yang gak kelihatan dari jendela.


---

Kai?
Dia liat semua itu dari bangku belakang.
Langsung update story:

> 📸 Foto kabur Shawn-Chessie tidur di bahu masing-masing
“MY BOY FOUND PEACE IN THIS CRUEL WORLD 😭🩵”




---

Dan di saat itu juga...

Gerrald buka HP-nya.
Liat Story Kai.

Lalu matiin layar.
Genggam HP lebih kenceng.

Tatapannya?
Diam.

Tapi bukan tipe diem yang pasrah.
Lebih ke... diem yang lagi mikir.

Mikir buat balas.


---

Episode 15 – Not That Same Kid Anymore
Lo boleh masih manggil gue Shawn. Tapi gue bukan Shawn yang dulu.


---

Study tour udah kelar.

Sekolah udah rame lagi kayak biasa — cuma, vibe-nya beda.
Shawn dan Chessie?
Sekarang kayak... power couple versi kalem.

Yang satu pendiam, tapi selalu hadir.
Yang satu cerewet dikit, clingy, tapi gak annoying.

Dan sekarang mereka duduk di kantin. Chessie meletakkan dagunya di meja, ngelirik Shawn sambil manyun.

> “Aku laper... Tapi aku pengen yang beda.”



Shawn noleh, nahan tawa. “Baru makan roti sobek tiga.”

> “Iya tapi itu snack. Aku mau makanan. Tapi bukan yang ini,” ujarnya, sambil ngedorong nampan makanannya.



Shawn berdiri, nyenderin tas ke kursi. “Oke, Princess. Mau apa sekarang?”

> “Es kopi susu kampus. Terus tempe mendoan. Sama... donat gula,” katanya cepat, sambil nunjuk-nunjuk menu.



Shawn ngangkat alis. “Minuman, cemilan, gorengan. Lo bikin paket combo sendiri?”

> “Cinta lo kan combo juga,” Chessie nyeletuk sambil ngedip.



“Gila lo,” jawab Shawn, tapi dia jalan juga buat beli semuanya.

Kai yang duduk agak jauh liatin sambil geleng-geleng.

> “Dulu bro gue dingin. Sekarang? iBoyfriend 15 Pro Max with clownproof love 🤡💗”




---

Shawn baru balik ke meja, baru mau naruh es kopi, tempe, dan donatnya...

Tiba-tiba—

> “Wah, lo udah kayak pelayan sekarang?”



Gerrald.
Muncul dari belakang, suara ketus, nadanya gak berubah sejak SD: ngeremehin, sambil senyum nyinyir.

Shawn noleh, nahan napas. “Ngapain lo?”

Gerrald duduk seenaknya di bangku kosong seberang. Chessie langsung melotot.

> “Gue cuma pengen ngobrol. Lo udah berubah banget ya,” kata Gerrald, tangannya main-mainin sendok.



“Kayaknya semua orang berubah,” jawab Shawn kalem. “Atau paling gak... pengen berubah.”

> “Gue kira lo bakal tetep jadi si bocah nangis yang gak bisa ngelawan.”



Shawn senyum kecil. “Sayangnya sekarang gue bisa ngomong tanpa gemeter.”

> “Tapi lo masih pengecut.”



“Kalau gue pengecut, lo gak akan sesensitif ini tiap ngeliat gue.”

> “Sensitif?” Gerrald berdiri, tangannya ngegebrak meja. Suara nampan kejedor bikin satu meja belakang noleh.



Chessie narik Shawn pelan.

> “Udah, Shawn. Ayo, cabut aja.”



Tapi Shawn diem. Tatapannya langsung ke Gerrald.

“Lo marah karena apa sih?” ujarnya pelan. “Karena gue gak diem aja waktu lo rendahin gue?”

Gerrald ngegas. “Karena lo ngerebut semua yang gue punya!”

Shawn nyengir kecil. “Lo emang pernah punya Chessie?”

Gerrald ngehentak.
Tinju pertamanya melayang — tapi Shawn ngeles pelan, kayak gerakan slow-mo.
Tenang. Santai. Tapi tegas.

> “Masih pakai cara lama, ya?” ucap Shawn.



Kai udah lari dari jauh, nyamperin.
“WOY, WOY, JANGAN BIKIN KONTEN BERANTEM DI KANTIN BRO—”

Satpam mulai berdatangan.

Gerrald ngehentiin gerakannya, tapi matanya penuh api.

> “Lo pikir lo keren sekarang?”



Shawn nafas pelan.
“Gue gak keren. Tapi gue gak takut lo lagi.”

Gerrald cengir dingin. “Ini belum kelar.”

> “Gue juga gak pengen kelar,” jawab Shawn datar. “Gue cuma gak pengen jadi anak kecil yang selalu kabur.”




---

Chessie narik Shawn, akhirnya beneran cabut dari kantin.

Di lorong, dia jalan sambil sebel sama udara.

> “Gue gak suka diteriakin kayak tadi,” gumamnya.



Shawn noleh. “Maaf ya. Harusnya gue langsung pergi.”

Chessie noleh balik, matanya sedikit berkaca.

> “Gue cuma takut... lo nyakitin diri lo sendiri cuma buat buktiin lo kuat.”



Shawn diem sebentar.

> “Gue kuat sekarang bukan karena harus. Tapi karena ada lo.”



Chessie langsung ngedeketin diri, narik lengan Shawn, nyenderin dagunya ke pundak dia.

> “Beliin aku cimol dong.”



Shawn ngelirik, senyum kecil.

“Lo romantis banget kalo laper.”

> “Gue clingy banget karena suka.”



Shawn megangin tangannya pelan.

> “Berarti lo boleh minta apa aja.”



> “Termasuk... lo jangan nyakitin diri lo sendiri lagi?”



“Deal.”

Episode 16 – Our Voices in the Static

Hari itu panas. Tapi bukan karena matahari.

Gerrald duduk sendirian di tangga belakang sekolah. Tangannya pegang HP, tapi layarnya udah gelap dari tadi. Angin siang numpang lewat sebentar, tapi gak ngebawa adem. Cuma debu, dan rasa yang udah kelamaan ngendap.

Di kepalanya, suara itu masih muter.

"CEPET JOIN! GUE UDAH DI LOBBY!"

Itu suara Shawn. Tiga tahun lalu.
Di malam-malam yang sekarang terasa jauh banget.


---

Tiga Tahun Sebelumnya

Jam 9 malam lebih dikit. Shawn duduk di lantai kamarnya, tablet di pangkuan, satu earphone nempel di telinga. Di layar: Gerrald udah online. Nama tim: "WeCryButWin."

"Bang, sabar, sinyal gue kayak hati—lemah," kata Shawn sambil nyengir.

"Elah, jokes lo makin jelek tiap malam," Gerrald nyaut sambil ngunyah ciki dari seberang.

Kadang mereka main sampai tengah malam. Kadang cuma buka game, terus malah ngobrolin hal random: crush-nya di sekolah, guru yang nyebelin, Zaidan yang selalu masuk ke kamar Shawn tanpa ketuk.

Kadang diem. Tapi bukan diem canggung. Diem yang tenang. Diem yang cukup karena suara nafas lawan bicara aja udah bikin gak ngerasa sendirian.

Dan itu hampir tiap malam.

Sampai suatu malam, gak ada notif dari Gerrald.

Shawn nungguin. Tapi gak nanya. Mikirnya: mungkin sibuk.
Besoknya? Masih gak ada.
Lalu seminggu. Lalu sebulan. Lalu... hilang.

Tanpa alasan. Tanpa penjelasan. Tanpa selamat tinggal.


---

Sekarang

Gerrald masih di tangga itu. Masih gak buka layar HP-nya. Tapi di kepala dia, layar masa lalu muter terus. Dan kali ini, rasanya kayak nonton ulang film yang dulu dia jadi tokoh utamanya — tapi sekarang cuma bisa jadi penonton.

Dia buka IG. Story terbaru: Shawn.
Senyum kecil, duduk bareng Chessie, dengan caption:

> "capek, tapi bahagia. 🍃🩵"



Dan di situ, Gerrald ngerasa sesuatu ngejepit dadanya. Bukan cemburu. Tapi sesuatu yang lebih tua dari itu.
Penyesalan.

"Gue pikir dulu... dia bakal tetap ada di tempat yang sama."

Tapi ternyata enggak.
Gerrald lah yang jalan pergi.
Dia yang mulai main sama circle Rayun.
Dia yang mulai berhenti ngechat duluan.
Dia yang ketawa waktu Shawn cuma diem di grup.
Dia yang bilang ke orang lain, "Ah, dia mah baperan."

Sekarang?
Shawn bukan yang dulu.
Dan dia sadar… mungkin Shawn gak akan balik lagi.


---

Di sisi lain sekolah, Shawn duduk di bangku belakang taman. Di sampingnya, Chessie duduk sambil ngunyah permen karet dan ngetap-tap layar HP-nya.

"Lo pernah punya temen yang... tiap malam telponan cuma buat main game?" tanya Shawn tiba-tiba.

Chessie noleh, nunduk dikit, terus ngangguk pelan. "Pernah. Tapi gak sering-sering amat sih."

Shawn ngelirik daun yang jatuh di sepatunya. "Gue dulu pernah. Hampir tiap malam. Kadang gak ngomong apa-apa, cuma dengerin napasnya aja tuh udah bikin tenang."

Chessie diem. Tangannya berhenti main HP.

"Terus kenapa berhenti?" tanyanya.

Shawn nyengir kecil. Tapi bukan senyum bahagia. Lebih ke... sisa luka yang udah lama gak dia pegang.

"Kayak radio... yang frekuensinya berubah. Suaranya masih ada, tapi makin lama makin berisik. Terus ilang."

Chessie noleh, nadanya lembut, "Mungkin lo masih bisa nyari frekuensi yang sama."

Shawn geleng pelan. "Dia bukan suara yang gue kenal lagi. Dan gue juga bukan pendengar yang sama."


---

Malamnya, Gerrald sendirian di kamarnya. Lampu mati. Cuma cahaya dari layar HP-nya.
Dia scroll galeri.
Nyari.
Terus ketemu.

Satu screenshot dari game. Lobby lama. Nama mereka masih ada.
[GERRxCRY]
[ShawnTakesL]
Status: READY.

Dia pencet lama foto itu. Tapi gak dihapus.

Cuma diem.
Lama.
Sampai akhirnya dia bilang ke dirinya sendiri,

"Maaf, Sh. Gue kira lo bakal tetep nungguin. Tapi ternyata... lo juga punya hidup sendiri."


---

Shawn di rumah buka buku catatannya.

Nulis:

> "Dulu suara kita kayak lagu pengantar tidur. Sekarang, kayak suara statik dari radio yang salah gelombang."



Dia taruh pulpen, tutup bukunya.
Tapi gak tidur.

Dia duduk.
Dan nunggu.

Entah nunggu apa.

Cuma... kalau-kalau ada satu suara dari masa lalu, yang nyasar balik.
Meskipun cuma sebentar.
Meskipun cuma lewat.

Episode 17 – Bukan Milik Semua Orang

Hari itu, udara sekolah kerasa lebih gerah dari biasanya. Jam makan siang, kantin rame, penuh suara celemek gesek meja, sendok jatuh, dan tawa dari pojokan.

Shawn lagi ngantri di pojok minuman, baru beli air kotak rasa jeruk. Belum sempet buka, ada tangan nyaut dari samping dan langsung narik lengannya pelan. Chessie.

“Lo ngapain sih ngantri sendirian?” celetuknya, jalan bareng dia ke arah meja kosong.

“Minum?”

“Ya gue juga haus,” katanya datar, lalu ngelirik ke tangan Shawn yang masih pegang dua minuman. “Itu dua-duanya buat lo?”

Shawn ngelirik, lalu nyodorin satu. “Enggak, satunya buat lo.”

Chessie diem sebentar, trus duduk. Tapi tangannya masih nempel di lengan Shawn beberapa detik sebelum dia ngelepas.

Mereka duduk berdua. Shawn baru buka minuman, tapi belum sempet minum, Chessie udah narik tempat duduknya lebih deket. Bangkunya diseret, mepet banget.

“Gak panas, tuh?” tanya Shawn.

Chessie nggak jawab. Dia buka roti, ngasih setengah ke Shawn tanpa nanya.

Shawn nyengir kecil. “Gue udah bawa bekel, loh.”

“Lo makan aja. Ini lebih enak.”

Shawn nerima juga akhirnya.

Dari arah meja lain, Kai duduk bareng anak kelas. Pas dia nengok, liat Shawn dan Chessie duduk mepet banget, dia langsung lempar ekspresi lebay.

Tapi Chessie udah nyorot dia duluan. Tatapannya datar, tajem, ngebuat Kai langsung angkat tangan kayak bilang ‘oke, fine, gue paham’.

“Kenapa ngeliatin dia gitu?” tanya Shawn pelan.

“Biasa,” kata Chessie, buka bungkus wafer pelan. “Dia suka nyari tempat duduk deket lo. Hari ini nggak sempet.”

Shawn diem, tapi matanya ngelirik Chessie. Nggak heran. Dari pagi, Chessie udah duduk bareng dia di kelas, ngikutin dia ke koperasi, bahkan sampe nyelip di balik tembok waktu Shawn ngobrol sama guru BK. Nggak nanya, nggak minta, cuma... ada.

Pas pelajaran terakhir bubar, Chessie jalan pelan sambil nahan lengan Shawn. Nggak banyak ngomong, cuma ngikut. Bahkan pas anak-anak lain nyamperin Shawn, nanya soal lomba, Chessie cuma berdiri deket dia. Nggak senyum. Nggak basa-basi.

Satu anak cewek dari kelas sebelah nyapa Shawn, “Eh, kamu yang kemarin lomba bahasa Korea ya?”

Shawn ngangguk sopan, “Iya, kemarin.”

Senyum cewek itu agak panjang. Mau lanjut ngobrol.

Tapi Chessie udah maju setengah langkah. Nggak bilang apa-apa. Nggak nyela juga. Tapi posisinya jelas: antara Shawn dan siapa pun yang mau terlalu deket.

Cewek itu langsung pamit.

Shawn noleh, pelan. “Lo kenapa?”

“Nggak papa.”

Chessie diem sebentar, lalu nunduk sambil narik lengan Shawn buat diajak jalan lagi. Tangan mereka nempel.

Di tangga belakang, mereka duduk. Shawn ngeluarin sisa air kotaknya. Chessie ngambilin juga tanpa nanya. Minum duluan.

“Enak kan?” Shawn nyeletuk.

Chessie ngangguk, tapi matanya masih ngeliatin halaman bawah. Lama.

“Lo cape?” tanya Shawn.

“Dikit. Tapi kalo duduk di sini, enakan.”

Shawn nyender ke tembok.

Chessie ikutan. Mepet. Nggak ngomong apa-apa lagi, cuma diem. Tapi tangannya nggak lepas dari ujung kaus Shawn.

Setiap kali Shawn gerak dikit, Chessie ikut narik lagi kausnya, seolah bilang jangan pergi kemana-mana dulu — tapi tanpa kata.

Dan Shawn?

Dia diem juga. Tapi ngelirik tangan itu sebentar. Dan nggak narik diri.

End of Episode 17.
Episode 18.

Sekolah hari itu bubar agak cepat. Langit udah mulai gelap, tapi anginnya adem, kayak ngebisikin, “jangan pulang dulu.” Shawn duduk di bangku taman belakang sekolah, hoodie-nya separuh dipakai, tangan muter-muterin botol minum kosong di paha. Dia lagi dengerin musik, tapi nggak fokus. Pandangannya kosong, tapi hati rasanya penuh.

Chessie muncul lima menit kemudian, nyeret tasnya kayak abis tanding lari maraton. Rambutnya agak kusut, tapi senyumnya tetep muncul duluan.

“Lama banget sih nungguin,” ujar Chessie sambil duduk mepet banget di sampingnya.

“Gw kira lo pulang duluan,” ujar Shawn, matanya masih ngadep ke rumput.

“Kan udah janji nungguin. Lagian juga... kamu itu suka lupa kalau aku suka nyempetin.” Chessie nyeletuk sambil pura-pura manyun.

Shawn ngelirik dikit, tapi senyum tipisnya nggak bisa disembunyiin. Chessie ngelihat itu, langsung nyenderin kepalanya ke bahu Shawn.

“Nggak usah pura-pura cool deh. Aku tau kamu seneng,” bisik Chessie, manja banget.

Shawn pura-pura ngelirik ke langit. “Gw nggak cool. Gw capek.”

“Yakin cuma capek? Bukan kangen?” Chessie ngangkat alisnya, goda.

Shawn diem sebentar. “Yaudah lah. Mungkin dikit.”

Chessie senyum makin lebar. Tangannya narik lengan Shawn dan dipeluk rapet. Kayak bantal jalanan.

“Eh, kamu kapan-kapan main ke rumah aku ya?” ujar Chessie tiba-tiba.

Shawn ngelirik, kaget. “Ngapain?”

“Ya main aja. Kan pengen liat Shawn kalau lagi nggak sok cool gitu.”

Shawn ketawa kecil. “Gw nggak sok cool, aneh.”

Chessie duduk tegak. “Terus, kalau aku tiba-tiba nanya... kamu lebih suka martabak manis atau asin?”

Shawn garuk kepala. “Apaan sih.”

“Ayo jawab. Penting nih buat masa depan hubungan kita.”

“Martabak asin.”

“Fix. Kita cocok.” Chessie ketawa ngakak sampai Shawn ikut ketawa juga.

“Gw nggak ngerti logikanya.”

“Ya pokoknya cocok aja. Kamu jangan banyak tanya. Kamu tuh tipe yang banyak mikir, ya?”

“Gw bukan banyak mikir. Gw realistis.”

Chessie megangin pipinya sambil senyum lebar. “Realistis tapi masih bisa peluk-pelukan gini sama aku.”

“Gw bukan peluk lo. Lo yang narik tangan gw dari tadi.”

“Yaudah. Biar aku peluk terus.”

Mereka diem sebentar. Angin sore lewat pelan-pelan. Beberapa anak lain udah mulai balik, tapi mereka berdua masih di situ.

Sampai akhirnya langit makin gelap. Di perjalanan pulang, mereka tetap chattingan. Sampai Chessie ngetik:

> “Kamu udah di rumah?”



> “Udah.”



> “Boleh aku nelpon?”



> “Mau ngomong apa?”



> “Random aja. Kan katanya kamu realistis. Aku pengen ngomong yang nggak logis.”



Akhirnya mereka sleepcall. Mulai dari obrolan nggak jelas: topik tentang mie yang lebih enak direbus atau digoreng, sampe bahas suara kodok yang suka muncul tiap musim hujan.

Sampai akhirnya, suara Chessie makin kecil. “Aku seneng, tau nggak…”

“Apaan?”

“Kita kayak gini. Kamu tuh kayak... tempat aku balik kalau seharian rame.”

Shawn diem sebentar. “Lo tau nggak, gw juga.”

“Jadi kita saling balik, ya?”

“Ya. Saling.”

Sementara itu, di tempat lain — Rayun buka story Chessie yang isinya potongan chat lucu sama Shawn. Dia diem. Terus geser ke DM, liat percakapan terakhir dia sama Shawn yang nggak dibales.

Di tempat lain juga, Gerrald baca postingan temen yang upload fotonya Chessie dan Shawn pas study tour. Mereka ketawa bareng, kelihatan deket banget.

Gerrald ngeklik like. Tapi jempolnya gemeter.

“Beneran segitunya dia ninggalin kita?” pikir Gerrald. “Beneran segampang itu dia bisa ganti rumah?”

Dan tanpa sadar, dua orang yang dulu paling keras ketawa bareng Shawn, sekarang cuma bisa nonton dari jauh.

Sementara Shawn dan Chessie? Mereka udah tidur. Masih nyambung di call. Suara nafasnya saling ngiringin.

Malam itu sepi. Tapi tawa mereka masih kedengeran—walau pelan.


---
Episode 19 – Aku Nggak Siap, Tapi Kamu Harus Pergi

Hari itu matahari lagi jinak. Hangat, tapi nggak nyelekit. Angin pelan-pelan narik daun-daun turun dari pohon belakang sekolah. Chessie duduk di bangku biasa mereka, tangannya muter-muterin sendok plastik di es krim yang mulai cair.

Shawn duduk di sebelahnya. Hoodie tipis, celana olahraga, rambut masih agak berantakan. Dia nyender, ngeliatin langit kayak nyari pola yang cuma dia bisa lihat.

"Enak juga ya sore kayak gini. Sepi," ujar Chessie pelan.

"Gw suka yang sepi," jawab Shawn. "Nggak terlalu banyak suara."

"Berarti kamu suka aku dong?" ujar Chessie sambil nyengir.

Shawn ngedip pelan. "Suaranya lo tuh kayak... volume 3 dari speaker 100 watt. Masih bisa dinikmatin."

Chessie ketawa, tapi tangannya gemeter dikit.

Shawn ngeh. Tapi dia diem.

"Shawn..." suara Chessie turun satu oktaf. "Aku mau bilang sesuatu. Dan kamu jangan dulu potong ya."

Shawn ngangguk.

"Aku keterima. Beasiswa. Di Amerika."

Detik itu, es krim di tangan Shawn berhenti berputar. Angin masih nyapu daun. Tapi dunia rasanya kayak nge-freeze.

"Semester depan aku harus berangkat," lanjut Chessie, cepat, kayak pengen buru-buru kelar. "Aku juga nggak nyangka. Tapi... ya. Terjadi aja."

Shawn diem.

Lama.

"Lo seneng?" tanyanya akhirnya.

Chessie nyengir kecil. "Banget. Tapi..."

Shawn noleh. "Tapi?"

Chessie nunduk. "Tapi aku takut. Bukan soal tempat barunya. Tapi soal ninggalin yang aku punya di sini."

Dia nggak bilang nama. Tapi Shawn ngerti.

"Maksud lo... gw?"

Chessie ngangguk pelan. "Aku tahu ini selfish. Tapi aku nggak siap ninggalin kamu, Shawn."

Shawn senyum. Tapi senyumnya kayak kaca yang retak pelan-pelan.

"Lo harus pergi," ujar Shawn akhirnya. Suaranya stabil. Tapi nadanya? Berat. "Kalo lo diem di sini cuma karena gw, gw bakal benci diri sendiri."

Chessie narik napas panjang. "Tapi aku takut kamu bakal lupakan aku."

"Gw bukan Gerrald," jawab Shawn cepet. “Gw bukan orang yang ninggalin.”

Chessie diem. Matanya mulai berkaca.

"Lo masih punya waktu kan?" tanya Shawn pelan.

Chessie ngangguk.

"Ya udah. Kita isi waktunya. Biar lo pergi bukan dengan penyesalan, tapi sama tawa."

Chessie geser, nyenderin kepalanya ke bahu Shawn.

"Aku boleh manja nggak malam ini?" ujarnya pelan.

Shawn noleh sedikit. "Manja sampe lo naik pesawat juga boleh."


---

📱 Malamnya:

> chessie.sentyou: “Kalau kamu disuruh nunggu aku 4 tahun, kamu bakal tungguin nggak?”



> shawn.lagibingung: “Gw ga bakal nunggu. Gw jalanin.”



> chessie.sentyou: “Jalanin?”



> shawn.lagibingung: “Bukan berarti gw berhenti hidup. Tapi kalo lo balik... gw masih di sini.”




---

Dan di tempat lain, di bangku yang pernah jadi saksi persahabatan mereka dulu...

Gerrald duduk sendiri.

Scroll foto-foto lama.

Lalu diam.

Lalu chat nggak terkirim:

> "Masih inget dulu kita main game tiap malem?"



> "Gue kangen lo, bro."




---

Suara telepon terhubung. Chessie dan Shawn sleepcall lagi. Tapi kali ini... ada waktu yang menghitung mundur.

Dan minggu berikutnya, Chessie resmi berangkat ke Amerika.

Satu bulan setelah kepergian itu, chat mereka mulai jarang.

Lalu... hilang.

Nggak ada notif. Nggak ada call. Nggak ada "aku kangen kamu."

Cuma satu hal yang tinggal:

> Terakhir dilihat: 30 hari yang lalu.



Dan Shawn duduk lagi di bangku taman belakang sekolah. Kali ini sendirian. Nggak ada es krim. Nggak ada tangan yang narik lengan hoodie-nya sambil bilang “aku kangen.”

Hanya hoodie yang mulai kusam dan playlist yang muter lagu yang dia nggak pernah skip sejak Chessie pergi.

Dan kali ini, Shawn diem lebih lama dari biasanya. Karena nggak semua kepergian bisa diisi dengan tawa. Kadang, cuma sisa napas yang kedengeran... Dan suara notifikasi yang nggak pernah datang lagi.
